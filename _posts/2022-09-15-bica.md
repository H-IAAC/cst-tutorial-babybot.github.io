### Existence, Hypotheses and Categories in Knowledge Representation


Cognitive architectures employ different means for knowledge representation. In this work, we describe how the Cognitive Systems Toolkit (CST), a toolkit for the construction of cognitive architectures addresses the issue of knowledge representation, by introducing the notion of a computational idea, as being an abstract and generic building block for representing multiple different pieces of knowledge. We particularly address how computational ideas can be used to represent both facts that really happened at an environment and just hypothesis that are not to be considered as being a part of existence, explaining how these are instances of general categories. At the end, we provide different examples to illustrate the subtle differences that are possible to be represented using this knowledge representation scheme.
